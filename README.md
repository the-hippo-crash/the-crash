# The Crash

A resume signing application, where employers, educational institutes and other organisations can sign the validity of somebody's (partially) resume.

The current version will only sign a file, like a diploma.

Generated private keys should be kept private and secure. Public keys should be published in the organisation's DNS records.

## To Use

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile sass
sass public/css/main.scss public/dist/css/main.css

# Run the app
npm start
```
